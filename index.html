        <h1>Treating patients: A Challenge, or Not?</h1>
        <p>Sponsored by Somemed Inc.</p>

        <h3>Significant challenges exist when managing PHN in the elderly<sup>1</sup></h3>
        <h4> <ins>Treatment considerations</ins><sup>1</sup></h4>
        <li>The patient is typically a human</li>
        <li>Elderly patients frequently have multiple comorbidities, take multiple medications, and are particularly
            sensitive to drug side effects</li>
        <li>In elderly patients with impaired physical function, drugs that cause dizziness, drowsiness, or somnolence
            may
            increase the risk of falls</li>

        <h3>LOREM<sup>®</sup> (loremin) can help with the challenge of brain management in the humans<sup>2</sup>
        </h3>

        <p>
            <h4>Indication and Usage</h4>
            LOREM<sup>®</sup> (loremin) tablets are indicated for the management of human brain activities. LOREM is not
            interchangeable with other loremin products because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles that affect the
            frequency of administration.
